								<a href="">I want the signup bonus, but don't want to pay the annual fee after the first year!</a>
							</dt>
							<dd>
							Most cards have a downgrade path. For example, one can get the Chase Sapphire Preferred 60,000 pt bonus, but then downgrade to a no annual fee card such as the Freedom after the first year. Simply send your bank a secure message, request through livechat, or call them to complete the process. This preserves your credit history while helping you avoid the annual fee.

								<a href="">Doesn't applying for too many cards negatively affect my credit score?</a>
							</dt>
							<dd>
							Contrary to popular belief, it's actually the opposite! A factor in determining your score is actually how many open accounts you have, and the more the better! The score is also based on the average age of accounts (hence, your average tends to be impacted at first, but helps reduce fluctuation if you build a solid base of long-term cards at a young age. Your total credit utilization can also affect it, so someone using $500 of a $5000 credit limit has 10% utilization, which is very high and can hurt your score. However, someone with $1000 usage of a $30,000 credit limit is only utilizing 3%, which is much better. I recommend using Credit Karma to find out what is affecting your score.
							</dd>
							<dt>
								<a href="">What is 5/24?</a>
							</dt>
							<dd>
							This can vary based on individual needs. The benefit of cashback is that there is a direct monetary value attached to your spending. For example, a card offering 4% back on dining gives you $4 per $100 spent. However, the value of a card with 4x pts on dining, which is 400 pts per $100 spent, is harder to gauge. For Chase, you always have the option  to cash out as cashback or use it as points, so your minimum redemption value is always as good as the cashback option. The points can be redeemed for even better value by transferring to certain partners, or used through the Chase Travel Portal. However, it can be more complex for American Express, where 400 points could result in less than $4 when redeeming for gift cards, but can provide you value  of over $20 when transferred to airlines for business class awards. Therefore, I always recommend beginners start with Chase due to its simplicity and flexibility.
							</dd>
							<dt>
								<a href="">I never accrue enough airline miles before they expire! What do I do?</a>
							</dt>
							<dd>
							The airline industry can be complicated to navigate. While I've never flown United, but whenever I fly Star Alliance carriers (EVA Air, Air China, Air Canada, etc.) I always accrue my miles with United. This is because compared to many Asian carrier loyalty programs that have a set expiration date no matter how often you fly with them, US based carriers extend the life of all your miles whenever there is any activity. As a result, I save my points in United and transfer the needed points remaining from Chase to book my award flights, such as EVA’s business class. Keeping points in the bank’s own reward portal also prevents points from ever expiring, so only transfer when you are ready to ready to redeem.
							</dd>
							<dt>
								<a href="">I am not an American citizen, am I eligible for Global Entry & TSA Pre?</a>
							</dt>
							<dd>
							Although TSA Pre is technically only available to U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents, one can obtain TSA Pre by applying for Global Entry, which includes TSA Pre as part of the membership. Currently, Global Entry is also available to citizens of 10+ other countries, including India, UK, and Taiwan.
							</dd>
							<dt>
								<a href="">How often can I get credit card signup bonuses?</a>
							</dt>
							<dd>
							It varies by bank. For example, American Express usually has a once-per-lifetime policy, meaning you ideally want to sign up for a card when a "historic high" offer is available. For Chase, depending on the card it could vary between 24-48 months. As these policies are always changing, check in the terms & conditions before you apply.
